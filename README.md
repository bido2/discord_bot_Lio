Hello, I created bot to discord that for now have only few commands but im still working at it.

Availble commands:
* 'roll dice' - dice roll simulation (1-6)
* 'temp city name' - getting the current temperature for 'city name' (I'm using free weather api from visual crossing so it's not perfect)
* 'hello' / 'Bye' - welcome/farewell
